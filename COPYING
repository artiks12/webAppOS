webAppOS license
================
License: EUPL 1.2+ (third-party dependencies may have other open-source licenses)
Files: All webAppOS code excluding third-party dependencies,
       which are distributed on their own terms.
       Third-party licenses are usually located inside the corresponding files or folders
       and/or jar-files (as *LICENSE* or *COPYING* files). The closest ancestor
       principle should be used when determining which license is applicable.

Some points clarified

EUPL makes no obstacle for linking webAppOS code with another software component
that could be proprietary. There is no kind of "viral effect" resulting from the EUPL licence,
in so far linking is done for interoperability
[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/news/eupl-and-proprietary-commer].
Thus, web apps, web services, and other modules designed for webAppOS and using webAppOS
APIs, can be proprietary and distributed according to your terms.

If substantial portions of third-party code were obtained under another compatible
copyleft license (e.g. GPL) making the reuse of this copyleft licence mandatory for
distributing that code, EUPL provides exceptions to the obligation to license derivatives
of webAppOS under the EUPL in favor to that compatible license.
